# Security Learning Journal

This repository documents my journey learning cybersecurity from scratch.
I am a first-year student focusing on defensive security, SOC fundamentals,
and hands-on labs.

Why this repo exists:
- To track my daily learning
- To build strong fundamentals
- To reflect on mistakes and improvements

This is not a tutorial repo.
This is a learning journal.

## Day 01 – Understanding What Cybersecurity Really Is

What I learned:
- Difference between offensive and defensive security
- What a SOC analyst actually does daily

What confused me:
- SIEM tools and log sources

What I will improve tomorrow:
- Learn basic networking terms
- Start TryHackMe networking room

Time spent: 2 hours
