# Mini SOC Detection Lab

This repository documents my learning process in understanding
basic SOC concepts and detection thinking.

I am focusing on learning fundamentals such as logs, alerts,
and how security analysts identify suspicious activity.

This is a learning-based repository, not a production project.



# Security Learning Journal

This repository documents my journey learning cybersecurity from scratch.
I am a first-year student focusing on defensive security, SOC fundamentals,
and hands-on labs.

Why this repo exists:
- To track my daily learning
- To build strong fundamentals
- To reflect on mistakes and improvements

This is not a tutorial repo.
This is a learning journal.

## Day 01 – Understanding What Cybersecurity Really Is

What I learned:
- Difference between offensive and defensive security
- What a SOC analyst actually does daily

What confused me:
- SIEM tools and log sources

What I will improve tomorrow:

- Start TryHackMe networking room

Time spent: 2 hours

Day-by-day learning notes are documented to track my understanding growth.

## Day 10
- Continued GitHub consistency
- Practiced commits and repo management
- Learning cybersecurity step by step
