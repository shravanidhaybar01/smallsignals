## Day 06 – Understanding False Positives

What I learned today:
- Not all alerts indicate real attacks
- False positives are common in SOC environments

Example I understood:
- Multiple failed logins from a legitimate user
can trigger a detection rule

Why this matters:
SOC analysts must balance detection sensitivity
with alert accuracy.

What confused me:
- How SOC teams decide acceptable alert levels

Next step:
Learn how detection rules are tuned over time.
