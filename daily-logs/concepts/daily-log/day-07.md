## Day 07 – Alert Tuning and Detection Improvement

What I learned today:
- Detection rules are not final and must be adjusted
- Alert tuning helps reduce false positives

Example tuning idea:
- Increase failed login threshold
- Add a short time window

Why today mattered:
It helped me understand how SOC analysts
improve detection quality over time.

What confused me:
- How tuning decisions are validated in real SOCs

Next step:
Learn how alerts are investigated and escalated.
